## RESPONSIVENESS TESTING

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

The deployed application was tested on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues. The bootstrap classes were used to be as responsive as possible and there was no need to add media queries.

It works as expected according to the wireframes and no issue was found.

## LIGHTHOUSE TESTING OUTCOMES

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

The deployed project was tested using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. The results for each page are listed bellow.

Notes:

* **Best Practices**: Displays images with incorrect aspect ratio - this will happen due to the uploading of photos by the user.

* Some tests were made using DevTool with Google Chrome, but it was very slow and other tests were made with Microsoft Edge, where the language was German. (Leistung = Performance, Barrierefreiheit = Accessibility)

## CODE VALIDATION

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

### HTML

The [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate all HTML files.
In order to properly validate the HTML pages with Jinja syntax, the steps are followed for each file:
